    <h3>A. Zhidian General Terms of Service</h3>
    <p><strong>1. Job Content</strong></p>
    <p>The jobs contained in Zhidian’s search results, or linked from those results, are created by people over whom Zhidian exercises no control. You acknowledge and understand that we have no control for the content of the job listings or other information posted therein. Zhidian’s job search results are indexed in an automated manner and Zhidian does not screen these jobs. We cannot confirm that users or employers are who they claim to be. Zhidian assumes no responsibility, and disclaims all liability, for the content, accuracy, completeness, legality, reliability, or availability of any job listing, information, or web site that is either included in Zhidian’s search results or linked to by the Website.</p>
    <p>The Website contains links to other sites on the Internet which are owned and operated by third party vendors and other third parties (the “External Sites”). You acknowledge that Zhidian is not responsible for the availability of, or the materials located on or through any External Sites. You should contact the site administrator or webmaster for those External Sites if you have any concerns regarding such links or the materials located on such External Sites.</p>
    <p><strong>2. Use of Zhidian</strong></p>
    <p>Zhidian’s Website is for your personal, non-commercial use only. If you wish to make commercial use of the Website, you must enter into an agreement with Zhidian to do so in advance. Please <a href="/support">contact us</a> for more information.</p>
    <p><strong>3. User Content</strong></p>
    <p>Some parts of the Website, such as message boards, job listings, and forums, may allow users to post text, information, images, audio, video, messages, and other materials, (any such materials a user submits, posts, displays, or otherwise makes available on the Website is referred to as “User Content”). Such functionality is designed to help readers obtain career and company information, facilitate communication, discuss ways to make career decisions, and to let users know of job opportunities. This User Content is provided by outside contributors, many of whom use anonymous screen names. They may occasionally post User Content, including messages or statements that are misleading, deceptive, or downright wrong. Zhidian does not endorse and is not responsible for any opinion, advice, information, or statement contained in the User Content made or displayed on the Website by third parties. You acknowledge that by accessing the Website, you may come into contact with content that you find harmful, offensive, threatening, indecent or objectionable and you acknowledge that Zhidian shall have no liability to you for the content including, but not limited to explicit language and other potentially offensive material.</p>
    <p>Users of the Website must not post User Content or information that is unlawful, fraudulent, discriminatory, threatening, abusive, libelous, defamatory, obscene or otherwise objectionable or that contains sexual, ethnic or racial or other discriminating slurs, or material which contains no relevant or constructive content, which goes beyond profanity into obscenity or abhorrence, or which is otherwise in violation of the law. Users are also prohibited from posting any User Content that contains proprietary information, trade secrets or confidential information. User Content may not contain any advertisements, solicitations, chain letters, pyramid schemes, investment opportunities, or other unsolicited commercial communication (except as otherwise expressly permitted by us), or encourage or cause spamming or flooding.</p>
    <p>You are prohibited from posting any User Content containing official identification information (whether your own or of another person) on the Website, such as social security number, passport number, national identification number, insurance number, driver’s license number, immigration number, or any other similar number, code, or identifier. Posting such identification information may lead to identity theft and other adverse consequences. Zhidian may remove such numbers but does not undertake any obligation to do so and undertakes no responsibility and disclaims all liability for posting of such numbers.</p>
    <p>Although Zhidian has no obligation to do so, Zhidian may monitor messages posted on the Website and reserves the right to delete any User Content or portion thereof which violate the above rules, messages, topics that are unrelated to the specific portion of the Website on which they are posted, advertisements, recruiting or other commercial messages, and any other User Content that Zhidian deems in its sole discretion is inappropriate. If you believe a message violates our policies, please <a href="/support">contact Zhidian</a> immediately so that we can consider its editing or removal. Zhidian does not promise to remove any User Content and interpretation of whether User Content violates any Zhidian policy always remains within the sole discretion of Zhidian. Zhidian reserves the right to disclose all User Content and other relevant information and the circumstances surrounding their transmission to any third party in order to operate the Website properly; to protect itself, its partners and its visitors; and to comply with legal obligations or governmental requests. This means Zhidian may honor court-mandated requests to reveal a user’s electronic address and identity.</p>
    <p>Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Zhidian reserves the right (but are under no obligation) to remove any job listings that directly or indirectly discriminate against applicants. Direct discrimination means that a job listing specifically makes it clear that they only want applicants that match a certain criteria, thereby excluding others because of their gender, race, age or disability. Indirect discrimination means that a job listing implicitly excludes certain classes of applicants by making it impossible for them to qualify for the job requirements. You understand and agree that it is your responsibility to refrain from posting any job listings that contain direct or indirect discrimination.</p>

    <p>(1) Treatment of publisher or speaker</p>
    <p>No provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be treated as the publisher or speaker of any information provided by another information content provider.</p>
    <p>(2) Civil liability</p>

    <p><strong>10. Claims of Infringement</strong></p>
    <p>U.S. Copyright Infringement.</p>
    <p>The Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998 (the “DMCA”) provides recourse for copyright owners who believe that material appearing on the Internet infringes their rights under U.S. copyright law. If you believe in good faith that materials hosted by Zhidian infringe your copyright, you (or your agent) may send us a notice requesting that the material be removed, or access to it blocked. The notice must include the following information as required by 17 USC. § 512(c)(3)(A): (a) a physical or electronic signature of a person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed; (b) identification of the copyrighted work claimed to have been infringed (or if multiple copyrighted works located on the site are covered by a single notification, a representative list of such works); (c) identification of the material that is claimed to be infringing or the subject of infringing activity, and information reasonably sufficient to allow Zhidian to locate the material on the site; (d) the name, address, telephone number, and email address (if available) of the complaining party; (e) a statement that the complaining party has a good faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law; and (f) a statement that the information in the notification is accurate, and under penalty of perjury, that the complaining party is authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed. If you believe in good faith that a notice of copyright infringement has been wrongly filed against you, the DMCA permits you to send Zhidian a counter-notice. Notices and counter-notices must meet the then-current statutory requirements imposed by the DMCA; see http://www.loc.gov/copyright/ for details. Notices and counter-notices with respect to the Website should be sent to Zhidian Copyright Notice, 7501 N. Capital of Texas Hwy, Building B, Austin, TX 78731, USA (copyright @ Zhidian.com) (remove spaces when sending email). We suggest that you consult your legal advisor before filing a notice or counter-notice. Also, be aware that there can be penalties for false claims under the DMCA.</p>
